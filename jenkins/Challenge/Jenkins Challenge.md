# üìå Deploy Java Application on Docker üê≥                       

## **Challenge Description**  
Altice company has developed a **Java-based Maven Application** and wants to automate the **build, test, and deployment** process using **Jenkins and Docker**. Additionally, **Prometheus** will be used for metric collection and disk space monitoring, nd **Grafana** will be used for visualizing the collected metrics.

The goal is to ensure that all code changes are automatically tested and deployed in a Docker environment without manual intervention.

---

## **Functional Requirements**  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Continuous Integration (CI)**  
   - Jenkins must automatically clone the source code from the GitHub repository.  
   - The code must be compiled using **Maven**.  
   - Unit tests must be executed before proceeding with the deployment.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Continuous Deployment (CD)**  
   - If tests pass successfully, the application should be packaged as a **Docker Image**.  
   - The Docker image must be stored in a **Docker Registry** (Docker Hub).  
   - The application should be deployed as a **Docker container** on a configured server.  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Configuration Management**  
   - Jenkins should read **environment variables** to set dynamic configurations (e.g., `DOCKER_IMAGE`, `DOCKERHUB_CREDENTIAL`, etc).  
   - The deployment process should allow selecting the environment (`QA`, `PROD`).  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Monitoring**  
   - After deployment, a step should check whether the service is running correctly (`curl http://localhost:8080/health`).  
   - Container logs should be captured for analysis (`docker logs <container_id>`).  

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Disk Space Monitoring**  
   - Ensure that the server has enough disk space before building or deploying the Docker container.  
   - Install Disk Usage plugin to check the available disk space.

## **Technologies Requirement**  
‚úî **Jenkins** for CI/CD  
‚úî **Docker** for containerization and deployment  
‚úî **Maven** for building and testing  
‚úî **GitHub** as the code repository  
‚úî **Prometheus** for metrics <br>
‚úî **Grafana** for metrics visualization

---

## **Step 4: Run and Validate**  
   - Execute the pipeline in Jenkins and validate whether the deployment was successful.  
   - Test the application by pulling the Docker image:
     ```bash
     docker pull index.docker.io/{username/xxxx}:latest
     ```
   - Check the container output:
     ```bash
     docker run --name {{provide project name}} index.docker.io/{username/xxxx}:latest
     ```
